This is a simple way to create an ipfs based apt repository.

Run the include.sh script to include packages and the activate.sh script to activate it.
If you want to share your collection, just run update.sh and send the string to your friend.
He can add it to his apt source file.

Example: deb [trusted=yes] file:/ipfs/QmeBQk1YZqHqnhq9x5jdCp2P3nMts4GnPVw2aJq43Lww5k/packages ./

Run "apt update" after you activated your repo.

If you encounter a "permission denied" error during "apt update", run fixfuse.sh and reboot your PC.
